# OSF high-level code generator component

Optimised to generate quick access classes to helpers, filters, validators and database models.

## Installation

You need at least php 7.1 and `composer`:

```bash
sudo apt install composer
```

### In your application via composer

This is the recommended way to use this feature in a non-osf project.

Just add `osflab/generator` in your composer.json file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osflab/generator.git
cd generator && composer update
```

Unit tests launch:
